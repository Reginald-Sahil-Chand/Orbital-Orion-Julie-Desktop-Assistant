Fun Fact:
=========
This software is based on a space theme.
All the functions, variables, and class names used are meaning full but follows a space theme.
This codebase will consist of comments based on humors at minimum to cheer up other developers.

oojda_control_panel.py:
=======================
Controls initialization for two oojda components.
[1] = oojda_launch_sequencer which houses all the packages, functions, modules in the sequence
it needs to be executed.
[2] = oojda_launch_service which houses all the services it needs to be run in the background.

Overview:
=========
Initiating Orbital Orion's - Julie Desktop Assistant's Launch Sequence Process ðŸš€
Initiating Orbital Orion's - Julie Desktop Assistant's Launch Service Process ðŸš€

This script serves as the launch sequencer and servicer starting point for our software.

Usage:
======
This class consists of two static methods named
initiate_oojda_launch_sequence and initiate_oojda_launch_service will be responsible to invoke
the required classes.

Guidelines:
===========
Import Statement Guidelines:
============================
Absolute imports are preferred over relative imports for better clarity and consistency.
Built-in Python modules appear first, followed by external modules with a one-line gap,
then internal and external types, and finally custom modules.

Usage Notes:
============
Ensure to follow PEP 8 guidelines for import statements.
Use absolute imports to avoid potential naming conflicts.
Keep the import section organized for better readability and maintenance.

Dependencies:
=============
Some modules may have dependencies on external libraries.
Refer to the module documentation for details.
