"""
Fun Fact:
=========
This software is based on a space theme.
All the functions, variables, and class names used are meaningful and follows a space theme.
This codebase will consist of comments based on humors at minimum to cheer up other developers.

oojda_main.py:
==============
Controls the execution of the overall software.
Can be referred to as the entry point for the Orbital Orion - Julie Desktop Assistant.

Overview:
=========
Initiating Orbital Orion's - Julie Desktop Assistant's Launch Process ðŸš€

This script serves as the launchpad for our software.
Executing start_engine_oojda_main() will ignite the program and commence our cosmic exploration.

Usage:
======
This module consists of one function named start_engine_oojda_main.
This function as the name suggests is responsible to start the main program flow.

Guidelines:
===========
Import Statement Guidelines:
============================
Absolute imports are preferred over relative imports for better clarity and consistency.
Built-in Python modules appear first, followed by internal types with a one-line gap,
then external modules and external types, and finally custom modules.

Usage Notes:
============
Ensure to follow PEP 8 guidelines for import statements.
Use absolute imports to avoid potential naming conflicts.
Keep the import section organized for better readability and maintenance.

Dependencies:
=============
Some modules may have dependencies on external libraries.
Refer to the module documentation for details.
